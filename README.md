# DDoS-Python-Script
(This is for educational practice only)
Extremely simple Python script which sents out a HTTP request under port 80 to a target IP, using threads to constantly send out packages to the target IP as well.

Used this to send out constant HTTP requests to my VPS server. As you can see here:

44.6k Requests in a matter of 5 minutes. It's indeed working as it should. 

What Is A DDos-Attack
A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is an attempt to make an online service unavailable
by overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources. They target a wide variety of important resources from banks to news websites, and present a major challenge to making sure people can publish and access important information

I do not recommend doing this outside of educational practice only since DDosing is indeed illegal.
